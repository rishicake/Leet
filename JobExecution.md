Job Execution

There are n jobs that can be executed in parallel on a processor, where the execution time of the ith job is executionTime[i]. To speed up execution, the following strategy is used.

In one operation, a job is chosen, the major job, and is executed for x seconds. All other jobs are executed for y seconds where y < x.

A job is complete when it has been executed for at least executionTime[i] seconds, then it exits the pool. Find the minimum number of operations in which the processor can completely execute all the jobs if run optimally.

Example

Consider n = 5, executionTime = [3, 4, 1, 7, 6], x = 4 and y = 2.

The following strategy is optimal using 1-based indexing.

Choose job 4 as the major job and reduce the execution times of job 4 by x = 4 and of other jobs by y = 2. Now executionTime = [1, 2, -1, 3, 4]. Job 3 is complete, so it is removed.
Choose job 4, executionTime [-1, 0, -, 1, 2]. So, jobs 1, 2, and 4 are now complete
Choose job 5, executionTime [-, -, - , - , -2] job 5 is complete.

It takes 3 operations to execute all the jobs so the answer is 3.

Function Description

Complete the function getMinimumOperations in the editor below:
getMinimumOperations has the following parameters.
int executionTime[n]: the execution times of each job int x the time for which the major job is executed int y, the time for which all other jobs are executed

Returns
int: the minimum number of operations in which the processor can complete the jobs

Constraints:
1 <=n<= 10^5

1 ≤ executionTime[i]≤ 10^9

1 <= y < x ≤ 10^ 9
